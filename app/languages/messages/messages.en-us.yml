      "I'm super excited to make new friends and help make your server even more awesome! :sparkles: Get started by using the `/help` command to find out everything I can do and how to set me up! :gear:\n\n
      Here are some tricks I know how to do:
      \n- **Moderation:** Setting up link blocking, auto-roles, and welcome messages.
      \n- **Notifications:** Twitch live and Youtube alerts.
      \n- **Utility:** Message translation to any language.
      \n- **Base:** Support, report, and quick help.\n\n
      All of this and much more you can manage easily through Discord buttons, editing, pausing, or disabling features whenever you want :pencil:\n\n
      If you need *help*, just call me using `/support` :heart:"
